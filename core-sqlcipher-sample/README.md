Siminov ORM (Object Relationship Mapping) - SQLCipher Template Application
==========================================================================

Siminov ORM is a open source Object/Relational Mapping solution for Android environments. It maps data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa). 

Siminov ORM not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.

About SQLCipher
---------------
Data Security plays important role when we talk about database. It protect your database from desctructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.

Android SQLite does not provide any protection against your database. There are many third party security implementation's which application developer can use in their application to protect their database.

SQLCipher is an open source extension to SQLite that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database le. SQLCipher has a small footprint and great performance so it's ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development.

Siminov provide implementation for SQLCipher database encryption security. Its easy and secured to use it.
