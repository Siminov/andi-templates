Siminov ORM (Object Relationship Mapping) - Library Template Application
===================================================

Siminov ORM Framework
------------

Siminov ORM is a open source Object/Relational Mapping solution for Android environments. It maps data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa). 

Siminov ORM not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. 


About Siminov Library Design
----------------------------
An Android library project is a development project that holds shared Android source code and resources. Other Andriod application projects can reference the library project and, at build time, include its compiled sources in their .apk files. Multiple application projects can reference the same library project and any single application project can reference multiple library projects.

Siminov provides mechanism to configure ORM for your library projects.
