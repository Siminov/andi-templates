Siminov Framework - Android Samples
===================================================

Siminov Framework is a open source Object/Relational Mapping solution for Android environments. It maps data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa). 

Siminov not only takes care of the mapping from Java/JavaScript classes to database tables (and from Java/JavaScript data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.
